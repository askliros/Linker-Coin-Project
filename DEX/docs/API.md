# EtherDelta API

EtherDelta's API allows you to query orders, trades, deposits, and withdrawals. Since EtherDelta is a smart contract, it is also possible to get trades, deposits, and withdrawals from the Ethereum API (through an Ethereum node or Etherscan API). EtherDelta's orderbook is an off-chain mechanism (a list of cryptographically signed orders) that you can only access through this API. The API allows you to see existing orders or place a new one.
